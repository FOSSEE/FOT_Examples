//A catenary cable is one which is hung between two points not in the same vertical line. As depicted in Fig. P6.17a, it is subject to no loads other than its own weight. Thus, its weight acts as a uniformload per unit length along the cable w (N/m). A free-body diagram of a section AB is depicted in Fig. P6.17b, where TA and TB are the tension forces at the end. Based on horizontal and vertical force balances, the following differential equation model of the cable can be derived in which calculus can be employed to solve the equation for the height of the cable y as a function of distance x:
//y = (Ta/w)*cosh((w*x)/Ta) - y0 + (Ta/w)
//(a) Use a numerical method to calculate a value for the parameter TA given values for the parameters w = 10 and y0 = 5, such that the cable has a height of y = 15 at x = 50.
//(b) Develop a plot of y versus x for x = âˆ’50 to 100.
