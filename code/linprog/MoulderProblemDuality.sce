// Example problem for sensitivity analysis - using duality theorem to determine the reduced cost

//Reference : Bradley, Hax, and Magnanti,"Applied Mathematical Programming", Addison-Wesley, 1977, chapter 3 

//A custom molder has one injection-molding machine and two different dies to fit the machine. Due to differences in number of cavities and cycle times, withthe first die he can produce 100 cases of six-ounce juice glasses in six hours,while with the second die he can produce 100 cases of ten-ounce fancy cocktail glasses in five hours. The molder is approached by a new customer to produce a champagne glass. The production time for the champagne glass is 8 hours per hundred cases. He prefers to operate only on a schedule of 60 hours of production per week. He stores the weekâ€™s production in his own stockroom where he has an effective capacity of 15,000 cubic feet. A case of six-ounce juice glasses requires 10 cubic feet of storage space, while a case of ten-ounce cocktail glasses requires 20 cubic feet due to special packaging.The storage space required for the champagne glasses is 10 cubic feet per one case. The contribution of the six-ounce juice glasses is $5.00 per case; however, the only customer available will not accept more than 800 cases per week. The contribution of the ten-ounce cocktail glasses is $4.50 per case and there is no limit on the amount that can be sold where as the contribution of champagne glasses is $6.00 per case with no limit on the bound. How many cases of each type of glass should be produced each week in order to maximize the total contribution?
